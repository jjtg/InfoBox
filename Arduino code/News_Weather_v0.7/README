Comments on the code: 

The code is currently lacking comment info, this will be added in future releases. 
In short, it can be considered on 3 categories: 

A) Serial communication - Located in the main loop; it handles the information being passed 
down by the script and classifies it into either news data or weather data, an additional 
character array can be added for warnings.

B) Printing logic - displayMessage(); this deals with displaying the message on a 16 characters 
by 2 LCD. It takes into consideration that the LCD display library handles 40 characters per line, 
hiding everything in excess of 16 on the buffer. Therefore, this subroutine formats the text so 
that it is displayed correctly. 

C) Interrups - btnPress() & toggleDisplay(); these are interrupts for user input, they will 
eventually stop any other code being served in favor of user input. Currently there is a bug 
with displayMessage() and the interrups, so this will have to be fixed.
